import { Model, KaldiRecognizer } from './resources/STT/vosk';

// Load the model (You'll need a Vosk model directory for this)
const model = new Model('<path_to_model_directory>');

// Assuming you have an audio file you want to process
const recognizer = new KaldiRecognizer(model, 16000);

// Use the recognizer with your audio data (This is just a basic example)
// Read audio data and feed it to the recognizer, then get the result
